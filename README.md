# Bitcoin Price Prediction Project Documentation

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project is focused on **Bitcoin price prediction** using four different machine learning models:

- Linear Regression
- XGBoost
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

The dataset is collected using the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`) and includes 5 years of historical BTC-USD OHLCV data.

The project follows a modular structure, with each component such as data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation defined in separate Python scripts.
